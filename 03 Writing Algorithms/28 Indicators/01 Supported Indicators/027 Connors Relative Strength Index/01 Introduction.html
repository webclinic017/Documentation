<p>This indicator represents the Connors Relative Strength Index (CRSI), a combination of the traditional Relative Strength Index (RSI), a Streak RSI (SRSI), and Percent Rank. This index is designed to provide a more robust measure of market strength by combining momentum, streak behavior, and price change.</p>
