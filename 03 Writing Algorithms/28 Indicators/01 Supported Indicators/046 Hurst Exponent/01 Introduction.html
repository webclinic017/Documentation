<p>This indicator represents the Hurst Exponent indicator, which is used to measure the long-term memory of a time series. - H less than 0.5: Mean-reverting; high values followed by low ones, stronger as H approaches 0. - H equal to 0.5: Random walk (geometric). - H greater than 0.5: Trending; high values followed by higher ones, stronger as H approaches 1.</p>
