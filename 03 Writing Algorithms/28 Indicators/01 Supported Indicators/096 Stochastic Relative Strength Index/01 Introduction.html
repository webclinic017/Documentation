<p>Stochastic RSI, or simply StochRSI, is a technical analysis indicator used to determine whether an asset is overbought or oversold, as well as to identify current market trends. As the name suggests, the StochRSI is a derivative of the standard Relative Strength Index (RSI) and, as such, is considered an indicator of an indicator. It is a type of oscillator, meaning that it fluctuates above and below a center line.</p>
